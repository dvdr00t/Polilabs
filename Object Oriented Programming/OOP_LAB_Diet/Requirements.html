<h1>Diet</h1>

<p>Write an application to manage a diet by means of nutritional values computation.
</p>
<p>The application must allow the definition of raw materials, their
use as ingredients for recipes, the definition of products and menus.
</p>
<p>All the classes must be in the package "<b>diet</b>".</p>


<h2>R1 - Raw Materials<br>
</h2>
<p>The system works though the facade class <b>Food</b>.
</p>
<p>To define a raw material, we can use the method <b>defineRawMaterial()</b> that accepts as arguments
the name, the kilo-calories, the amount of proteins, carbohydrates (carbs), and fat;
all the values refer to 100 grams of raw material. The name of the raw material can be considered unique.

<p>To retrieve some information about the raw materials we can use the method <b>rawMaterials()</b> which
returns a list of raw materials, sorted by name in alphabetic order.
To get info about a specific material, we can use the method <b>getRawMaterial()</b> that accepts the name
of the raw material and returns the corresponding raw material.

<p>The raw materials returned by the above methods are objects implementing the interface <b>NutritionalElement</b>,
which provides the getter methods <b>getName()</b>, <b>getCalories()</b>, <b>getProteins()</b>, <b>getCarbs()</b>, <b>getFat()</b>.
Calories are expressed in KCal, while proteins, carbs, and fat are expressed in grams.

<p>Moreover the interface includes the method <b>per100g()</b> that indicates whether the values
refer to 100 grams of nutritional element or represent an absolute value. For raw materials 
the nutritional values are always expressed per 100 grams, therefore the method returns <code>true</code>.


<h2>R2 - Products</h2>

<p>The diet may include also pre-packaged products (e.g. an ice cream or a snack).
Products are defined by means of the method <b>defineProduct()</b> of class Food
accepting as arguments the name, the kilo-calories, the amount of proteins, carbohydrates (carbs), and fat.
Such values express the value for the whole product, therefore the method per100g() returns <code>false</code>.
The name of the product can be considered unique.

<p>To retrieve information about the products we can use the method <b>products()</b> of class Food that returns
a collection of products sorted by name. To get information about a specific product, method <b>getProduct()</b> is
available that accepts the name of the product and returns the corresponding object.
<p>
Both methods return the products as object implementing the interface 
<i>NutritionalElement</i> (described in the previous requirement); 
the values are expressed for the whole product
(i.e. the method <i>per100g()</i> returns <i>false</i>).
</p>


<h2>R3 - Recipes</h2>

<p>Raw materials can be combined as ingredients of recipes.
To define a recipe we can use the method <b>createRecipe()</b>, from class <i>Food</i>,
that accepts as argument the name of the recipe.
The name of the recipe can be considered unique.

<p>A recipe is represented by an object of class <b>Recipe</b> that allows
adding new ingredients by means of its method <b>addIngredient()</b> accepting
as arguments the name of the raw material and the relative amount in grams.

<p>Class Recipe implements the interface <i>NutritionalElement</i> and the values are
expressed per 100 grams.

<p>To retrieve the information about the recipes we
can use the method <b>recipes()</b>, of class <i>Food</i>, that returns a collection
of recipes sorted by name. To get information regarding a specific recipe we
can use the method <b>getRecipe()</b> that accepts as argument the name of the
recipe and return the corresponding recipe.
Both methods return recipes as <i>NutritionalElement</i>

<p>
The method <b>toString()</b> in class <i>Recipe</i> returns a string 
that contains all the ingredients, one per per line, using the following format
<i>"Material : ###.#"</i> where <i>Material</i> is the name of the raw material 
and <i>###.#</i> is the relative quantity. 
Lines are all terminated with character <i>'\n'</i> and the ingredients 
must appear in the same order they have been added to the recipe.
</p>

<ul class="hint"><li><strong>Warning</strong>:
While the sum of  the amounts of ingredients (in grams) of a recipe is not
necessarily equal to 100g, the nutritional values of the recipe must refer
to an ideal portion of 100 grams.
</li></ul>

<h2>R4 - Menu</h2>

<p>A menu consists of either portions of recipes or pre-packaged products.

<p>Menus can be create with method <b>createMenu()</b> of class <i>Food</i>,
that accepts as argument the name of the menu.

<p>A menu is represented by class <b>Menu</b> that allows to add a portion of 
a recipe to the menu through method <b>addRecipe()</b> that
accepts as argument the name of the recipe and the size of the portion, in grams.

<p>To add an item of a pre-packaged product, class <i>Menu</i> provides the method 
<b>addProduct()</b> that accepts as argument the name of the product.

<p>Class <i>Menu</i> implements the <i>NutritionalElement</i> interface; in this case the values are
referred to the whole menu.
