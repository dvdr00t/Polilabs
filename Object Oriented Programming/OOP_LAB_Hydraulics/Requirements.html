<h1>Hydraulic System Simulation</h1>

Design and implement a program to manage the simulation of an hydraulic system.<br>
All the classes must belong to the package <b>hydraulic</b>.
<p>

<h2>R1. Elements and pipes</h2>
A hydraulic system is composed of elements (of different types) connected to each other 
(through pipes that are not explicitly modeled in the system).
<p>
A system is represented by an object of class <b>HSystem</b> that allows adding
new elements through the method <b>addElement()</b> that accepts 
as argument an object of class <b>Element</b> and adds it to the system components.
<p>
By means of method <b>getElements()</b> it is possible to get an array containing all and only the 
elements that compose the system.


<h2>R2. Simple elements</h2>

The simple elements are represented by the classes <b>Source</b>, <b>Tap</b>, and <b>Sink</b>.
<p>
All elements have a name that can be read through the getter method <b>getName()</b>.
<br>
It is possible to connect the output of an element to the input of another element by 
means of the method <b>connect()</b>
that accepts as argument the element whose input should be connected to the output of the subject:
<i>a.connect(b);</i> connects the output of element <i>a</i> to the input of element <i>b</i>.
<p>
The invocation of method connect on a <i>Sink</i> object has no effect.
<p>
Given an element, it is possible to know to which other output element it is connected by means
 of the method <b>getOutput()</b> that returns an <i>Element</i> object.
<p>


<h2>R3. Complex elements</h2>
<p>
In addition to the simple elements described above, there are some complex elements.
The "T" element, represented by class <b>Split</b>, allows splitting the input flow into
two equal output flows. For this class, the <b>connect()</b> method accepts an additional argument
specifying which output is being connected, such parameter may assume
the values <i>0</i> for the first output and <i>1</i> for the second output.
<br>
For this class, it is possible to know which elements are connected to the outputs, by means
of the method <b>getOutputs()</b> that returns an array with the two connected elements. 
<p>

<h2>R4. Simulation</h2>
<p>
Given a valid system, i.e. a tree with a source as the root and where each path ends with a sink,
it is possible to compute flow and how it is split among the distinct paths.
<p>
The computation takes place into two phases: in the first phase the parameters of
the elements belonging to the system are defined, in the second phase the 
actual simulation starts. 
<p>
During the first setup phase it is possible to:
<ul>
<li> define the flow of a Source through the method <b>setFlow()</b> that accepts a number 
representing the cubic meters per hour.
<li> set the opening of <i>Tap</i>s using the method <b>setOpen()</b> that accepts a boolean argument.
When a tap is open the output flow is equal to the input flow, otherwise the output is zero.
</ul>

<p>
For the T split the input flow is divided into two equal output flows (each a half of the input flow).
<p>
The <b>simulate()</b> method of class <i>HSystem</i>, performs the flow computations for each element in the system
starting from each source (for the source, only the output flow, and for the sink just the input flow).
This method requires as argument an object implementing the <b>SimulationObserver</b> interface, that provides a single method.
<p>
When, during simulation, the input and output flows are known for an element method <b>notifyFlow()</b> must be called
on the observer passing the element type, the name, and the input and output flows;
if any of the flows is not defined (e.g. for the <i>Source</i> and <i>Sink</i>), the constant <i>NO_FLOW</i> can be used.
</p>

<ul class="hint">
<li>Hint: given an object, to find out if it is an instance
of a specific class the operator <i>instanceof</i> can be used.<br/>
E.g. <i>if( element instanceof Source )</i>.
<li>Warning: you are not required to implement the interface <i>SimulationObserver</i>, you only need to use it;
an example of implementation that simply prints to the console the notifications, is given in class <i>PrintingObserver</i>.
</ul>
