<h1>Medical Clinic</h1>
<p>
Implement a system to manage patients of a medical clinic.
The classes are hosted in package <b>clinic</b>.</p>
<p>
The system must meet the following requirements.</p>


<h2>R1: Patients</h2>

<p>The main class of the program is class <b>Clinic</b>.</p>
<p>
Patients are characterized by the first name, the last name, and the
unique social security number (SSN). 
 New patients can be added to the system by means of method <b>addPatient()</b>.</p>
<p>
The information about a patient can be retrieved by means of method
<b>getPatient()</b> that given an SSN returns a string with the format
<i>"&lt;Last&gt; &lt;First&gt; (&lt;SSN&gt;)"</i>.
If the patient does not exist, exception <b>NoSuchPatient</b> is thrown.</p>


<h2>R2: Doctors</h2>

<p>Doctors are characterized by the first name, last name, SSN, unique badge ID, 
and the specialization (e.g. "cardiologist", "dentist", etc.).
New doctors can be added to the system by means of method <b>addDoctor()</b>.</p>
<p>
Method <b>getDoctor()</b>, given a badge ID, returns a string with 
the following format: <i>"&lt;Last&gt; &lt;First&gt; (&lt;SSN&gt;) [&lt;ID&gt;]: &lt;Specialization&gt;"</i>. 
<p>
If the doctor does not exist, exception <b>NoSuchDoctor</b> is thrown.</p>
<p> 
Keep in mind that doctors can be patients of the same clinic they work in.</p>

<h2>R3: Patient registration</h2>

<p>When accepted, a patient is assigned to one of the clinic doctors. To
this aim, method <b>assignPatientToDoctor()</b>
is provided. Patient is identified by means of her SSN, and doctor is
identified by means of her badge ID. If the doctor does not exist,
exception <b>NoSuchDoctor</b> is thrown. 
Further, if the patient does not exist, exception <b>NoSuchPatient</b> is thrown.</p>
<p>
By means of method <b>getAssignedDoctor()</b> that accepts a patient SSN,
it is possible to obtain the ID of the Doctor assigned to that person.
If the patient does not exist a <i>NoSuchPatient</i> exception is thrown. If there is no
doctor assigned to the patient a <i>NoSuchDoctor</i> is thrown.</p>
<p>
The method <b>getAssignedPatients()</b> accepts a doctor ID and
returns the list of all patients SSN of that doctor. If there is no doctor
with the given ID a <i>NoSuchDoctor</i> exception is thrown.</p>


<h2>R4: Loading</h2>

<p>The method <b>loadData()</b> of class <i>Clinic</i> accepts a <i>Reader</i>
parameter and loads from it the information about patients and doctors.<br>
The text file is organized by rows; each row contains info about
either a patient or a doctor.</p>
<p>
Rows containing a person's info begin with letter <i>"P"</i> followed by first name,
last name, and SSN. Rows containing doctor's info start with letter <i>"M"</i>,
followed by badge ID, first name, last name, SSN, and specialization.<br>
The elements on a line are separated by the <i>";"</i> character, possibly
surrounded by spaces that should be ignored.</p>
<p>
In case of error in the data present on a given row, the method should be able
to ignore the row and skip to the next one.<br>
In case of IO errors the method propagates an <i>IOException</i> to the caller.</p>


<h2>R5: Statistics</h2>

<p>
The method <b>idleDoctors()</b> returns the collection of
doctors that have no patient at all, sorted in alphabetic order (last name and then first name).</p>
<p>
The method <b>busyDoctors()</b> returns the collection of
doctors that are assigned a number of patients larger than the average.</p>
<p>
The method <b>doctorsByNumPatients()</b> returns a list of strings
containing the name of the doctor and the relative number of patients, sorted by decreasing number.<br>
The string must be formatted as "<i>### : ID SURNAME NAME</i>" where <i>###</i>
represent the number of patients (printed on three characters).</p>
<p>
The method <b>countPatientsPerSpecialization()</b> computes the number of
patients per (their doctor's) specialization.
The elements are sorted first by decreasing count and then by alphabetic specialization.<br>
The strings are structured as "<i>### - SPECIALITY</i>" where <i>###</i>
represent the number of patients (printed on three characters).</p>

<h3>Hint:</h3>
<ul class="hint">
<li> Formatting can be performed using the 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#format-java.lang.String-java.lang.Object...-"><i>String.format()</i></a> method.<br>
	E.g. <i>String.format("%3d", i)</i> prints integer variable <i>i</i>
	on three characters.
</ul>
<p>


<!--
<h2>R6: Saving</h2>
The method <b>saveData()</b> accepts a file path as a parameter and
saves the information of doctors and patients on that file, according
to the format specified in the previous requirement.
<p>
 In case of IO errors the method propagates an IOException.
