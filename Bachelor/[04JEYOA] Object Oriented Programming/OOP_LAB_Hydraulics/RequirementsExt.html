<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hydraulic System Simulation - <b>Extended</b></h1>
<p>
Extend, inside class <b>HSystemExt</b> the 
<a href="Requirements.html">functions already implemented</a>
in class <i>HSystem</i>.
<p>
The class <b>HSystemExt</b> extends class <i>HSystem</i>.


<h2>R5. Multi-split</h2>
<p>Class <b>Multisplit</b> represents an extension of class <i>Split</i> 
that allows multiple outputs.
The constructor accepts, in addition to the name, the number of outputs.
</p><p>
The method <b>connect()</b> accepts two arguments: 
the element to be connected and the output number to connect it to.
Outputs are numbered starting from <i>0</i>.
<p></p>
To find out which elements are connected to the outputs of a multi-splice,
method <b>getOutputs()</b> can be used; it returns an array of the 
connected elements.
If no elements is connected to an output the corresponding item in the
array is set to <i>null</i>.
</p><p>
In preparation for the simulation method <b>setProportions()</b>
can be used; it accepts a series of <i>double</i> values that 
define the proportion according to which the input flow is
divided among the outputs.
</p>
<ul class="hint">
<li>Assume that the number of proportions passed to the method is equal
to the number of outputs and that their sum is <i>1.0</i>.
</ul>


<h2>R6. Visualization</h2>

Method <b>layout()</b> of class <i>HSystemExt</i> (warning: not <i>HSystem</i>) returns a string containing
the layout of the system using ASCII characters and spacing.
<p>
For instance, a system composed of a <i>Source</i>, connected to a <i>Tab</i>, 
that is connected to a <i>Split</i> whose outputs are connected to <i>Sink</i>s,
would return a layout like the following one:
<pre>
[Src]Source -> [R]Tap -> [T]Split +-> [sink A]Sink *
                                  | 
                                  +-> [sink B]Sink *
</pre>
	
<h2>R7. Element removal</h2>
<p>
Method <b>deleteElement()</b> of class <b>HSystemExt</b> deletes from the system
a previously added element; the method takes as input parameter the name of element to be deleted.
<p>
If such element is not a <i>Split</i>, and is connected to other elements in input/output,
modify the connections appropriately. Taking the example from R5, the layout after deleting
the <i>Tap</i> should be like the following one:
<pre>
[Src]Source -> [T]Split +-> [sink A]Sink *
                        |
                        +-> [sink B]Sink *
</pre> 

<h2>R8. Maximum flow rate and related alarms</h2>
The new class <b>ElementExt</b> extends the class <b>Element</b> adding
a method <b>setMaxFlow()</b>, which takes as input parameter a real number,
representing the maximum flow rate of an element. If an element takes in input
a flow greater than its max flow rate, the element is in danger of breaking down.
For <b>Source</b> objects, since they do not have any input,
calls to the <b>setMaxFlow()</b> method should not have any effect.
<p>
The <b>HSystemExt</b> class contains an overloaded version of the <b>simulate</b> method, 
taking as parameter the boolean <b>enableMaxFlowCheck</b>: if the latter is true, 
the method should check also the maximum flow of elements, notifying 
an error if the element input flow is greater than its maximum flow rate.
The overloaded <b>simulate</b> method takes in input also an object implementing
the <b>SimulationObserverExt</b> interface, which extends the <b>SimulationObserver</b>,
adding a method <b>notifyFlowError</b>, which can be used to notify the aforementioned
maximum flow error, passing the element type, the name, the input flow and the maximum flow rate.

<ul class="hint">
<li> Hint: it is allowed to modify the <b>Source</b>, <b>Split</b>, <b>Tap</b> and <b>Sink</b> classes
to make them extend the <b>ElementExt</b> class (since the latter in turn extends <b>Element</b>).
</ul>
